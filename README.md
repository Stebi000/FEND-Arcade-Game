## Instructions

This is a version of the classic game Frogger, developed as a demonstration on how to use object-oriented JavaScript.
A starter code containing the main game's engine and resource loader has been provided. The goal was to develope all the objects and the functions to render all the characters and the texture, control them and define the game's rules.

## Play

To run the game, download it and double click on the `index.html` file.

## How to Play

be careful to avoid the bugs along the way or you will die.
use the four arrows arrow keys, `up`, `down`, `left`, and `right` to move.
